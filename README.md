# Modeling-Quantum-Many-Body-Systems-using-Neural-Autoregressive-Density-Estimator
Project goal:  To create an efficient program that generates the ground state wavefunction and energy for a given quantum system size and Hamiltonian using neural networks and machine learning.  Utilizes pyTorch machine learning library and neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) architecture. Current system has demonstrated successful convergence for small (2-5 qubit) Transverse Field-Ising Model (TFIM) systems.  Current work involves diagnosing erratic network behavior for larger systems and parallelization of sample generation for increased efficiency.
